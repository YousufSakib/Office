Navigate waterways through lush mangrove forests, encountering Bengal tigers and diverse wildlife. Immerse in local culture, visit villages and witness the harmonious coexistence of nature and communities. A unique adventure awaits in this ecological wonderland. The Sundarbans mangrove forest is one of the most extensive single such forests in the world (140,000 ha). It lies on the delta of the Bay’s Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s Sundarbans World Heritage Site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats, and small islands of salt-tolerant mangroves. It presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the man-eating Bengal tiger, and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python. Bagerhat, hosts the magnificent Sixty Dome Mosque, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
